# ðŸ”§ Fix localStorage Save Issues - Manual Patch Instructions

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Branch:** fix-localstorage-save  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot + mephistia

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Summary

The Pixel Craft Catalog Editor saves data correctly to localStorage, BUT the XP Balancer (progression.js) cannot read the items because:

1. Main editor saves to localStorage.setItem('pixelcraft_editor_data', ...)
2. Balancer reads from localStorage.getItem('items')
3. These are DIFFERENT keys â†’ Balancer gets null

## âœ… Solution

Save items to BOTH keys:  
- Keep main data in 'pixelcraft_editor_data' (existing functionality)  
- ALSO save items separately in 'items' (for balancer compatibility)

## ðŸ”§ KEY CHANGE in state.js

In the save() method, ADD this line after the main save:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('items', JSON.stringify(state.items));
```

This ensures balancer.html can read items from localStorage.

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

1. Apply changes  
2. Import items in main editor  
3. Click Force Save button  
4. Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage  
5. Verify BOTH keys exist: 'pixelcraft_editor_data' AND 'items'  
6. Open balancer.html  
7. Items should appear in XP Analysis
